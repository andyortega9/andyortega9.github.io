## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
* Lab 1

I loved working in this lab mainly because it was my first time coding. I learned how to print out messages as well as coding with others. The experience itself felt fun considering everyone was new to this, and feeling so accomplished after finishing the code.

* Lab 4

This was a fun lab because I started to learn how to use arithmetic operators. The lab also included the use of if statements which was new to me. Most importantly, I liked the lab due to the team effort of participating.

* Lab 10

This was a fun lab, considering my partner and I had many similarities. I learned how to use mutiple if and for statements to find a counties population as well as find highest and lowest population density from states. I also enjoyed this lab as I saw myself working the most on the lab, pushing myself beyond my knowledge.
